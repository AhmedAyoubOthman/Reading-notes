# Text

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings,paragraphs) .
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Introducing CSS

+ CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Basics Javascript Instructions

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Eachstatement is like a step in a recipe.
 Scripts contain very precise instructions.
 - For example, you might specify that a value must be rememberedbefore creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store morethan one piece of related information.
 - JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

# Decisions and Loops 

## Comparsion Operators:
## Evaluating Conditions

You can evaluate a situation by comparing on value in the script to what you expict it might  be. The result will be a `Boolean`: `True` or `False`. 

### And here is an examples:

+ `==` is equal to

+ `!=` is not equal to

+ `===` strict equal to

+ `!==` strict not equal to

+ `>` greater than

+ `<` less than

+ `>=` greater than or equal to

+ `<=` less than or equal to
