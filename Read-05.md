# Comparsion Operators:
# Evaluating Conditions

You can evaluate a situation by comparing on value in the script to what you expict it might  be. The result will be a `Boolean`: `True` or `False`. 

## And here is an examples:

+ `==` is equal to

+ `!=` is not equal to

+ `===` strict equal to

+ `!==` strict not equal to

+ `>` greater than

+ `<` less than

+ `>=` greater than or equal to

+ `<=` less than or equal to





# Logical operators

It`s allow to compare the results of more than one Comparsion Operators.

+ `&&` Logical and

+ `||` Logical or

+ `!` Logical not

# Loops

Loops check a condition . If it returns true , a code block will run .
 Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true , the code block will run again .
 
  It repeats until the condition returns false . There are three common types of loops :
  
  ## FOR
   
  If you need to run code a specific number of times , use a for loop . (it is the most common loop.) In a for loop , the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run .
   
## WHILE
    
 If you do not know how many times the code should run you can uses the while loop . Here the condition can be something other than a counter , and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true .
    
 ## DO  WHILE
 
   The do...while loop is a very  similar to the while loop, but has one key  differenc; it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least one, even if the condition evaluatis to false.
