## What is a script and how do I create ones

script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 



# Expressions:

n JavaScript, expressions are divided into two main types: Assignment expressions and Return value expressions. Assignment expressions include giving values to variables, and they only involve one value. Returning value expressions require more than one constant or value and usually involve calculation or mathematical operation.

# Operations:

Expressions rely on operators so that they can yield one value from more than one value. The types of operations we can do in any expression depend on the data type included inside the expression.

- Assignment operators.
- Arithmetic operators.
- Comparison operators.
- Logical operators.
- String operators.
